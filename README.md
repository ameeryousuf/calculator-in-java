# calculator
Basic calculator in java capable of addition, subtraction, multiplication and divison
This Java program takes two integer values as input from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user's choice. The program is designed in a modular way to make it easier to maintain and extend.

The program first prompts the user to enter two integer values. It then presents the user with a menu of options for performing arithmetic operations. The user can choose to add, subtract, multiply or divide the two input values.

The program uses separate methods for each operation, which are called based on the user's choice. For example, if the user selects addition, the program calls the "addition" method which takes the two input values as arguments and returns their sum. Similarly, for subtraction, multiplication and division, there are separate methods that are called.

The program also implements exception handling to handle divide-by-zero errors. If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program will catch the exception and display an error message to the user.

Overall, this program provides a simple and efficient way to perform basic arithmetic operations on two integer values. The use of modularization makes the program easier to maintain and extend in the future, while the use of exception handling improves the program's reliability and user-friendliness.

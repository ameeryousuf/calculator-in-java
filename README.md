# Java Basic Calculator

A simple **Java calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations: **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**. The program is modular, easy to maintain, and includes exception handling for reliable user interaction.

## Features

- Accepts **two integer inputs** from the user.
- Provides a **menu** to select operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- **Modular design**: each operation is handled in a separate method.
- Handles **divide-by-zero errors** gracefully with proper error messages.

---

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter **two integer values**.
2. Displays a **menu of arithmetic operations**.
3. Executes the selected operation by calling the corresponding method.
4. Displays the **result** on the screen.
5. If division by zero is attempted, an **error message** is shown instead of crashing.
